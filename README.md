# 1D Kalman Filter Localization

This project implements a simple 1D Kalman Filter in C++ to estimate the position and velocity of a moving object based on noisy position measurements.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **State:** `[position, velocity]`
- **Measurements:** Only noisy **position** observations
- **Prediction and Correction:** Standard Kalman filter equations
- **Uncertainty Modeling:** Process noise and measurement noise
- **Outputs:** Estimated position, estimated velocity, and evolving state covariance matrix
- **Visualization:** (Optional) Export to CSV and plot with Python using `matplotlib`

âœ… Over time, the filter:
- **Reduces uncertainty** (smaller covariance matrix values)
- **Smooths noisy measurements**
- Estimates **velocity**, which was never directly measured

cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Compile
make
```

### Run

```bash
./kalman_filter
```

Outputs results to console.

## ðŸ“š Notes

- **Process noise** models uncertainty in the motion model.
- **Measurement noise** models sensor inaccuracies.
- Initial uncertainty is set high to simulate starting with poor knowledge.
- Kalman Filter fuses predictions and measurements optimally to minimize mean square error.

## ðŸ¤– Future Work
- Extend to 2D / 3D tracking (position and velocity vectors).
- Compare with ground truth paths.
- Implement Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for nonlinear models.
